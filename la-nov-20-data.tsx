            "Representing most of Kern County, including Bakersfield, Ridgecrest, and Quartz Hill, CD 23 is the most Republican district in California—and the 23rd most Republican district in the entire country. Unsurprisingly, House Minority Leader and Trump minion Kevin McCarthy has held this seat for years. It’s pretty unlikely that he’ll lose it now, but Kim Mangone is putting up a great fight—in the primary, she won 33.5% of the vote, a better showing than any primary challenger McCarthy has ever faced.",
            "An Air Force veteran, systems engineer, and single mom with no political experience, Mangone has run a surprisingly strong grassroots campaign on a platform of not being Kevin McCarthy. She prioritizes universal health care, supports the Green New Deal, and promises to fight for working families and invest in bringing well-paying green jobs to her district.",
            "Mangone raised a total of $510,000, nearly 99% of which came from small donors who gave less than $200. More than two-thirds of that funding came in a sudden surge in Q2 of 2020—she brought in $360,000 in a single quarter. This still puts her severely behind McCarthy, who’s raised over $16.6 million, mostly from big donors like Comcast, Amazon, Big Pharma, and the fossil fuel industry. But Mangone’s momentum in fundraising is a sign that her grassroots support is growing. If anyone has a shot at unseating McCarthy, it’s her.",

Now special election incumbent Republican Mike Garcia will face off against Democrat Christy Smith.",

While he can be proud of legislation like a bill he co-authored to ban private prisons, his climate change platform is disappointingly timid in a year of West Coast infernos and what may be record-breaking hurricane activity.",

He even advocates a $1,000-a-month UBI.",

While those are all good things, one issue to flag is that Consumer Watchdog has formally requested an investigation of Gonzalez’s predecessor, Ricardo Lara, over what they believe is a pay-to-play scandal that may partly involve payments to and from Gonzalez’s campaign fund. The consumer advocacy group refers to Gonzalez as “Lara’s handpicked successor,” and though their request to the AG came just over a year ago we haven’t been able to find any public follow-up about an investigation. Meanwhile, almost 90% of the outside spending on Gonzalez’s campaign in the 2019-2020 cycle came from a single SuperPAC funded by major oil companies in a district which California Environmental Justice Alliance has said “houses CA’s worst environmental disasters and neighbors’ communities at ground zero for West Coast oil and gas operations.”`,

In a candidate questionnaire she decries America’s unequal healthcare system as “a human rights violation and a form of apartheid,” and lists as a personal role model Mayan indigenous feminist Rigoberta Menchú. In other words, Castillo is a real-deal progressive, and though her campaign is a longshot, she’s doing SD 33 a service by not allowing the incumbent to hold a safely blue seat unopposed.`,

However, there was a very vocal contingent of residents in Koreatown who felt that Herb Wesson was bypassing their wishes as constituents by not notifying the community of the plan or holding any public comment until it was already underway—which is a legitimate gripe to have. However, the campaign against it was clearly not just about a matter of process. You can be “for” bridge housing in theory, but when you’re against it where homeless people actually live, your support becomes a hard purchase for us to make. It’s understandable that Koreatown residents should want a public say about public works, but the unhoused are residents as well, and if their voices don’t count then how is protesting bridge housing not the NIMBYism of the more fortunate?`,

This measure applies a rent cap on homes built before February 1, 1995, capping annual rent increases at 7% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index, whichever is lower. The measure implements a “just cause” standard on eviction proceedings in the city. The measure also establishes an updated Landlord-Tenant Commission with the ability to initiate lawsuits, implement new renter protections, and operate independently from the city council, city manager, and city attorney. Measure RC would add stability to the lives of the 59% of Burbank residents who rent their homes and expand the possibility of who can afford to live in the city in the future. Vote YES on Measure RC.`,

Göran Eriksson is the only incumbent seeking reelection, as the other four councilmembers are either mid-term (Fisch and Lee), termed out (Sahli-Wells) or declining to seek a second term (Small).`,
            `Incumbent Eriksson, together with the other right-leaning candidates Robert Zirgulis and Heather Wollin, are the darlings of Protect Culver City, a landlord-funded PAC which bankrolled the anti-renter Measure B. The PAC went from decrying the hardship of “Mom ‘n Pop” landlords who couldn’t throw tenants on the street during COVID-19 to adopting a black badge favicon and “defend the police” platform amidst the George Floyd “riots”. While Zirgulis and Wollin are running on an explicitly pro-cop agenda, Eriksson has a track record as the sole dissenting voice on a progressive Council.`,
            `The candidates in the center are native son Albert Vera and Khin Khin Gyi. Vera has a nice-guy reputation in Culver City as the son of a former City Councilmember and owner of the landmark Sorrento Italian Market. A former cop, he also has a criminal record stretching from 2004-2008 marked by unusual leniency from prosecutors, thanks no doubt to his family’s prominence in the community. His campaign walks a centrist tightrope, calling for affordable housing without rent control, dialogue around systemic racism without defunding the police, and bold action on the environment without mentioning fossil fuels. Khim Khin Gyi is a physician and past president of the Culver City Democratic Club who opposes defunding the police.`,
            `Thankfully, the group of eight is rounded out by three true progressives who would continue the Council’s efforts to center underrepresented voices in Culver City. Yasmine-Imani McMorrin, who has pledged not to accept contributions from developers, tobacco, fossil fuel or law enforcement, supports a 50% reduction in the CCPD budget and is committed to upzoning and strong renter protections. She has racked up endorsements from US Representative Karen Bass, the Heart of LA Democratic Club, the Stonewall Democratic Club, Westside Young Democrats and the California Young Democrats. Like McMorrin, Freddy Puza is a member of Protect Culver City Renters and has echoed the need to cut the police budget in half. Darrel Menthe also supports renter protections and inclusionary zoning to increase the housing stock, but offers less explicit support for other reform measures including defunding the police. McMorrin is the clear leader in this group of three progressives, who if elected would join forces with incumbents Alex Fisch and Daniel Lee for a sweep of the Council and a new era for the city.`,

The only prospect for renter relief would be some future voter-approved ballot measure.`,
            `Even before COVID-19, the housing crisis had reached a breaking point in Culver City, which is the only city on the westside with no renter protections. Nearly half of the city’s households are renters, of which 43% are rent-burdened (paying more than 30% of their income on rent) or severely rent-burdened (paying more than half their income on rent). Last August, local groups loosely organized as “Protect Culver City Renters” successfully petitioned City Council to adopt a year-long rent freeze capping increases at 3%, with the goal of protecting tenants from retaliatory eviction while the city debated a permanent measure. Predictably, a PAC funded by out-of-town landlords and cynically dubbed “Protect Culver City” quickly emerged and paid canvassers $15 per signature for Measure B, which they frequently mischaracterized as for rent control. Against the backdrop of the spiraling pandemic-induced rent crisis, the City Council voted in July to continue the interim freeze through October 31st.`,
            `Proponents of Measure B argue that renters can rely on the statewide Tenant Protection Act, which caps annual increases at 10% and places the burden of enforcement on renters. But as families across the city face severe housing instability, the statewide backstop measure doesn’t cut it and the City Council should retain the ability to work with the community to craft meaningful and tailored relief. “B” is for Bad - vote No on Measure B.`,

Duran has been accused by employees at city hall of sexual harassment to the tune of $500,000 in settlements. He gave city jobs to Grindr hookups. He doesn’t pay his taxes. He used his position on the Gay Men’s Chorus of Los Angeles (where there were also accusations of sexual harassment) to funnel political donations from Athens Disposal, who were rewarded with a fifteen-year city contract. We could easily add another fifty pages to this guide going into detail about how John Duran is an out of control garbage monster.`,
            `The LA Times demanded he step down, and that’s before you even get to his friendship with Ed Buck, whom Duran has allegedly been harassing sex workers to not testify against in Buck’s upcoming murder trials. He is d-r-i-p-p-i-n-g in real estate and developer money. Despite the West Hollywood City Council voting to censure Duran last year, he has gotten an endorsement from State Assembly member Richard Bloom (who is another person we don’t think you should vote for) and for some reason, Antonio Villaraigosa, which we’ll be sure to file away for later.`,
            `Once upon a time West Hollywood was a pretty progressive place. Having been unincorporated until 1984, it was formed by a coalition of renters to implement rent control when LA County was looking to abolish it. Once incorporated, West Hollywood immediately put some of the strongest rent control laws in the country in place (that the 1995 Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act took the teeth out of FYI). It was the first city to create a domestic partner registry as well as extending benefits to domestic partners of city employees. It was the first city in Southern California to decriminalize marijuana. Over time like a lot of progressive things and the LGBTQ movement in general, West Hollywood slowly slipped into the comfort of liberal stability and focused its energies on the production and maintenance of rainbow capitalism and becoming one of the most concentrated populations of gay white men in the world.`,
            `West Hollywood isn’t going to return to its progressive roots anytime soon but that isn’t to say that the possibility isn’t always stirring below the surface. The options here are not great; most of the candidates are either extremely focused on businesses, have fairly open disdain for their homeless neighbors, are against defunding the police or are part of the non-profit industrial complex. The one thing most of these candidates do agree on is renter protections. This is especially important because there is a significant population of seniors from the LGBTQ community who are dependent on living in their rent-protected apartments and often do not have family members to count on for help. West Hollywood residents that look at the DSA-LA voter guide for advice on who to vote for would be best off electing Shepi Shyne and Marco Colantonio.`,
            `Shepi Shyne has pledged not to take any developer money, which is something she has actually stuck to and is calling for increased renter protections and supportive and transitional housing. She wants to move some of West Hollywood’s funding from their contract with the LA County Sheriff’s Department to more public works and social programs to address crime and increase MET teams. She also calls for making bathroom and laundry facilities available 24 hours a day for houseless residents. She is endorsed by AFL-CIO and UNITE Here Local 11`,
