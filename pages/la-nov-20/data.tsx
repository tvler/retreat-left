            `This is the fight of our lives — led by the person who has been fighting his entire life on behalf of the working class. When other candidates were cozying up to segregationists, Bernie was getting arrested with civil rights leaders. When other candidates voted for war and bloated military budgets, Bernie showed he had the guts to oppose imperialism. While other candidates raise money from Wall Street and fossil fuels and big pharma and the insurance industry, Bernie steers his supporters to picket lines to support workers. While other candidates are fêted by the Democratic establishment and corporate media, Bernie makes enemies of the oligarchy. When other candidates campaign as if this is a personality contest, Bernie says, “Not me, Us.”`,
            `Bernie is not the movement, but he has catalyzed a movement that will win Medicare for All, tuition-free college, a Green New Deal, expanded equality and the protection of reproductive rights. This movement will dismantle mass incarceration, endless wars, wall street omnipotence and anti-worker trade deals. This movement is the strongest coalition to take on the systemic issues of our time. Bernie Sander’s base is the most multi-racial, gender and sexual identity diverse, and, crucially, the most working-class. And only the working class can build the future we deserve.`,

            "Representing most of Kern County, including Bakersfield, Ridgecrest, and Quartz Hill, CD 23 is the most Republican district in California—and the 23rd most Republican district in the entire country. Unsurprisingly, House Minority Leader and Trump minion Kevin McCarthy has held this seat for years. It’s pretty unlikely that he’ll lose it now, but Kim Mangone is putting up a great fight—in the primary, she won 33.5% of the vote, a better showing than any primary challenger McCarthy has ever faced.",
            "An Air Force veteran, systems engineer, and single mom with no political experience, Mangone has run a surprisingly strong grassroots campaign on a platform of not being Kevin McCarthy. She prioritizes universal health care, supports the Green New Deal, and promises to fight for working families and invest in bringing well-paying green jobs to her district.",
            "Mangone raised a total of $510,000, nearly 99% of which came from small donors who gave less than $200. More than two-thirds of that funding came in a sudden surge in Q2 of 2020—she brought in $360,000 in a single quarter. This still puts her severely behind McCarthy, who’s raised over $16.6 million, mostly from big donors like Comcast, Amazon, Big Pharma, and the fossil fuel industry. But Mangone’s momentum in fundraising is a sign that her grassroots support is growing. If anyone has a shot at unseating McCarthy, it’s her.",

While he can be proud of legislation like a bill he co-authored to ban private prisons, his climate change platform is disappointingly timid in a year of West Coast infernos and what may be record-breaking hurricane activity.",

He even advocates a $1,000-a-month UBI.",

As Council President, he orchestrated the past term in which Los Angeles faced skyrocketing rents and homelessness and responded almost exclusively with criminalization and neglect. Over 99% of city council votes have been unanimous, and the few times the city council walked back its own inhumane criminalization, such as when it finally voted down the city’s criminalization ordinance of sidewalk sleeping, the result was orchestrated by a revolt of the council’s “progressive” wing (Mike Bonin and Marqueece Harris-Dawson) against Wesson’s rule, in responsive to massive grassroots pressure. He’s also been named (though not indicted) as a person of interest in an FBI investigation into bribery and corruption, centered on Jose Huizar and hotel developments in Downtown Los Angeles. Still, he’s heading into this race as a massive favorite, with well over a million dollars raised and endorsements from the County Democratic Party, most local unions, and an army of establishment city politicians.`,

Former City Councilwoman Jan Perry has long been a political opponent of Herb Wesson, with numerous political clashes during their shared time on the city council culminating in Wesson overseeing a redistricting of City Council districts explicitly to break up Perry’s base. Jan Perry has raised over $700,000 for this race, and is endorsed by an array of establishment politicians, albeit a much smaller array.

Janice put in good work on housing issues, got Measure H on the ballot, and subsequently used that money towards shower programs and urgent care beds in San Pedro. She also pushed a rent stabilization ordinance in unincorporated LA County that caps rent increases at 3% and requires just cause for eviction. Contradicting these efforts is her vote to support efforts in overturning Martin v. Boise. Worse still, Hahn supported the appointment of Nicole Tinkham as Interim Public Defender in 2018. Tinkham had no criminal law experience, is a big proponent of law enforcement, and provided civil defense to Sheriff’s Deputy Scott Sorrow after he shot 15-year-old William Fetters in the back while he was biking with his friends.`,

              Harabedian supports ending cash bail, eliminating the death
              penalty, and kicking ICE out of LA County. He’s endorsed by San
              Francisco’s newly elected progressive DA, Chesa Boudin, an ally to
              the Black Lives Matter movement. Another challenger, Darrell Park,
              is an environmentalist and businessman who supports 100% renewable
              electricity for the county by 2030 and free public transportation.

              and has been endorsed by Ground Game LA. As Harabedian and Park
              are the only two challengers running against a single incumbent,
              we feel comfortable recommending a vote for either of them for
              this seat. Both will be strong progressive challengers against
              incumbent Kathryn Barger.

            `This is perhaps the most important local race in 2020. The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office is the largest in the country, so the race has fittingly received national attention. There’s a nationwide trend of so-called “progressive prosecutors” running for office, and now we have the chance to vote in one of our own. Our current DA Jackie Lacey has spent the last eight years prosecuting poor people of color at appalling rates while failing to hold any law enforcement accountable for the over 500 extrajudicial killings they have meted out during her tenure. She supports capital punishment and has fought against all kinds of reforms. We stand with Black Lives Matter and our coalition partners in demanding that Jackie Lacey Must Go!`,
            `Lacey has two opponents. The former DA of San Francisco George Gascón is a career police officer and prosecutor who promises to be a reformer. There is little doubt he would be better than Lacey, but that is an extremely low bar. Much like Lacey, he has come under fire for not prosecuting killer cops in San Francisco, leading to weekly protests in front of the Hall of Justice. Sound familiar?`,
            `The other contender is Rachel Rossi, a public defender who has never been in law enforcement. While many of her proposals are similar to Gascón’s, her rhetoric during the campaign has skewed to the left of him. She is more emphatic about decreasing the filing of charges, increasing pre-trial diversions, and creating systems of accountability for the DA’s office. She speaks openly about the long-standing conflict of interest between prosecutors and law enforcement. She advocates for decriminalizing sex work and homelessness, and abandoning gang enhancements. As abolitionist organizations, we typically avoid making recommendations in DA races, but the harm reduction inherent in having non-cop as DA is too significant to ignore. We recommend Rossi.`,

Bond measures are one of the quickest methods of rapidly acquiring financing, but also one of the most frustrating. This matters more than ever for Prop 13, which is the largest school construction bond in state history. The immense amount of support for the bill and the virtual nonexistence of an opposition to it make it hard to argue with. The bill’s focus on matters of safety and not on dubious plans of modernization also make it attractive.
