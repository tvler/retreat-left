            `This is the fight of our lives — led by the person who has been fighting his entire life on behalf of the working class. When other candidates were cozying up to segregationists, Bernie was getting arrested with civil rights leaders. When other candidates voted for war and bloated military budgets, Bernie showed he had the guts to oppose imperialism. While other candidates raise money from Wall Street and fossil fuels and big pharma and the insurance industry, Bernie steers his supporters to picket lines to support workers. While other candidates are fêted by the Democratic establishment and corporate media, Bernie makes enemies of the oligarchy. When other candidates campaign as if this is a personality contest, Bernie says, “Not me, Us.”`,
            `Bernie is not the movement, but he has catalyzed a movement that will win Medicare for All, tuition-free college, a Green New Deal, expanded equality and the protection of reproductive rights. This movement will dismantle mass incarceration, endless wars, wall street omnipotence and anti-worker trade deals. This movement is the strongest coalition to take on the systemic issues of our time. Bernie Sander’s base is the most multi-racial, gender and sexual identity diverse, and, crucially, the most working-class. And only the working class can build the future we deserve.`,

            "Representing most of Kern County, including Bakersfield, Ridgecrest, and Quartz Hill, CD 23 is the most Republican district in California—and the 23rd most Republican district in the entire country. Unsurprisingly, House Minority Leader and Trump minion Kevin McCarthy has held this seat for years. It’s pretty unlikely that he’ll lose it now, but Kim Mangone is putting up a great fight—in the primary, she won 33.5% of the vote, a better showing than any primary challenger McCarthy has ever faced.",
            "An Air Force veteran, systems engineer, and single mom with no political experience, Mangone has run a surprisingly strong grassroots campaign on a platform of not being Kevin McCarthy. She prioritizes universal health care, supports the Green New Deal, and promises to fight for working families and invest in bringing well-paying green jobs to her district.",
            "Mangone raised a total of $510,000, nearly 99% of which came from small donors who gave less than $200. More than two-thirds of that funding came in a sudden surge in Q2 of 2020—she brought in $360,000 in a single quarter. This still puts her severely behind McCarthy, who’s raised over $16.6 million, mostly from big donors like Comcast, Amazon, Big Pharma, and the fossil fuel industry. But Mangone’s momentum in fundraising is a sign that her grassroots support is growing. If anyone has a shot at unseating McCarthy, it’s her.",

While he can be proud of legislation like a bill he co-authored to ban private prisons, his climate change platform is disappointingly timid in a year of West Coast infernos and what may be record-breaking hurricane activity.",

He even advocates a $1,000-a-month UBI.",

While those are all good things, one issue to flag is that Consumer Watchdog has formally requested an investigation of Gonzalez’s predecessor, Ricardo Lara, over what they believe is a pay-to-play scandal that may partly involve payments to and from Gonzalez’s campaign fund. The consumer advocacy group refers to Gonzalez as “Lara’s handpicked successor,” and though their request to the AG came just over a year ago we haven’t been able to find any public follow-up about an investigation. Meanwhile, almost 90% of the outside spending on Gonzalez’s campaign in the 2019-2020 cycle came from a single SuperPAC funded by major oil companies in a district which California Environmental Justice Alliance has said “houses CA’s worst environmental disasters and neighbors’ communities at ground zero for West Coast oil and gas operations.”`,

In a candidate questionnaire she decries America’s unequal healthcare system as “a human rights violation and a form of apartheid,” and lists as a personal role model Mayan indigenous feminist Rigoberta Menchú. In other words, Castillo is a real-deal progressive, and though her campaign is a longshot, she’s doing SD 33 a service by not allowing the incumbent to hold a safely blue seat unopposed.`,

            `Let’s be clear: Freddie Rodriguez is probably in the bottom 20% of worst Democrats in the State Assembly. Despite representing a safely blue district that has twice voted for ballot measures fighting mass incarceration, Rodriguez routinely skips votes that would ameliorate the worst effects of the CA carceral system or restrain abusive over-policing. He also stays off votes on environmental protection and has declined to vote in favor of public banking, worker and tenant protections, and protections for sex workers. He even joined with Republicans to kill a bill that would offer basic protections for arrestees like prompt hearings and reasonable limits to cash bail. He’s taken money from Chevron, tobacco giant Reynolds American, a bevy of police PACs, Anheuser-Busch, PepsiCo, and more, and has benefited from sizeable independent expenditures by PACs bundling cash from cops, realtors, and big pharma, and from Dart Container Corporation, “the world’s largest manufacturer of foam cups and containers.”`,
            `Rodriguez’s opponent, Republican Toni Holle, has been on the Pomona City Council for the last seven years. Her website advertises her support for Prop 13 property tax exemptions and her opposition to AB 5 (which extended protections to Uber drivers and other gig economy workers) and Prop 15 (the DSA-endorsed Schools & Communities First). She also decries mandatory childhood vaccination, sex ed in public schools, voter fraud, and “free healthcare to illegal immigrant.”`,

              power in Los Angeles, as does the other primary contender Mónica
              Garcia. Garcia served 13 years on the LAUSD board, spending a good
              chunk of that time as the board president as well. Ultimately,
              these two candidates are running large, well-oiled campaigns.
              Cyndi Otteson, however, is the candidate we are most interested
              in. Otteson supports a rent freeze and vacancy tax. This is big,
              especially when you consider D14 is home to some of the highest
              concentration of unhoused people in the country. Per her campaign
              website, she rejects money from developers, corporations, fossil
              fuel interests, and the charter school lobby. She also believes
              the city should eminent domain vacant commercial properties to
              build more affordable housing.

              (Sebastian was fired after this bribery was investigated by the
              press). Now, MRT is termed out, so he and corrupt establishment
              mainstay Herb Wesson, who just termed out of his reign as
              president of LA City Council in District 10, decided to swap
              seats. Healthy democracy, right?
            </>,
            `Wesson’s failures as city council president are expansive. As Council President, he orchestrated the past term in which Los Angeles faced skyrocketing rents and homelessness and responded almost exclusively with criminalization and neglect. Over 99% of city council votes have been unanimous, and the few times the city council walked back its own inhumane criminalization, such as when it finally voted down the city’s criminalization ordinance of sidewalk sleeping, the result was orchestrated by a revolt of the council’s “progressive” wing (Mike Bonin and Marqueece Harris-Dawson) against Wesson’s rule, in responsive to massive grassroots pressure. He’s also been named (though not indicted) as a person of interest in an FBI investigation into bribery and corruption, centered on Jose Huizar and hotel developments in Downtown Los Angeles. Still, he’s heading into this race as a massive favorite, with well over a million dollars raised and endorsements from the County Democratic Party, most local unions, and an army of establishment city politicians.`,
            `But there’s a hitch. Wesson is facing two other candidates with support from the party establishment. Former City Councilwoman Jan Perry has long been a political opponent of Herb Wesson, with numerous political clashes during their shared time on the city council culminating in Wesson overseeing a redistricting of City Council districts explicitly to break up Perry’s base. Jan Perry has raised over $700,000 for this race, and is endorsed by an array of establishment politicians, albeit a much smaller array. While Jan Perry is probably more progressive than Wesson, it’s not by much. Her most recent position was in Mayor Eric Garcetti’s pro-business “Economic and Workforce Development Department”.`,

              politicians in California. She has raised about $900,000 for this

Janice put in good work on housing issues, got Measure H on the ballot, and subsequently used that money towards shower programs and urgent care beds in San Pedro. She also pushed a rent stabilization ordinance in unincorporated LA County that caps rent increases at 3% and requires just cause for eviction. Contradicting these efforts is her vote to support efforts in overturning Martin v. Boise. Worse still, Hahn supported the appointment of Nicole Tinkham as Interim Public Defender in 2018. Tinkham had no criminal law experience, is a big proponent of law enforcement, and provided civil defense to Sheriff’s Deputy Scott Sorrow after he shot 15-year-old William Fetters in the back while he was biking with his friends.`,

There’s a nationwide trend of so-called “progressive prosecutors” running for office, and now we have the chance to vote in one of our own. Our current DA Jackie Lacey has spent the last eight years prosecuting poor people of color at appalling rates while failing to hold any law enforcement accountable for the over 500 extrajudicial killings they have meted out during her tenure.

Much like Lacey, he has come under fire for not prosecuting killer cops in San Francisco, leading to weekly protests in front of the Hall of Justice. Sound familiar?`,

While many of her proposals are similar to Gascón’s, her rhetoric during the campaign has skewed to the left of him. She is more emphatic about decreasing the filing of charges, increasing pre-trial diversions, and creating systems of accountability for the DA’s office. She speaks openly about the long-standing conflict of interest between prosecutors and law enforcement. She advocates for decriminalizing sex work and homelessness, and abandoning gang enhancements. As abolitionist organizations, we typically avoid making recommendations in DA races, but the harm reduction inherent in having non-cop as DA is too significant to ignore. We recommend Rossi.`,

Unfortunately, Prop 14 perpetuates the lack of accountability and makes it worse by exempting its programs from legislative oversight, with any amendment requiring a 70% vote. These flaws might be due to a real estate developer putting this measure on the ballot without even direct input from the existing stem cell board, the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM). Finally, as a bond measure, Californians will have to pay back nearly double the amount that we borrow from wealthy people to finance it. We support stem cell research, which is already legal and underway in California for over a decade, but Prop 14 isn’t necessary and will undermine the public interest.

            `It’s no wonder that REALTORS® are spending millions to push Prop 19: it will increase displacement in rapidly-gentrifying neighborhoods while draining the state treasury to give some of the wealthier people in society more property tax breaks. Specifically, it will limit the value of the capped assessment that children who live in their parents’ home can get to $1 million, allowing the value above that amount to be assessed at a higher rate. $1 million is already less than the market value of increasing numbers of houses in areas like the Crenshaw District and Echo Park that working class families used to be able to afford. Having to pay property tax on the full market value above the cap will force these working class families to sell and move out, which means more sales for REALTORS®. Also, Prop 19 increases the number of times homeowners can claim this cap from once (i.e., when you retire) to three times, further increasing inequality. While removing the current cap on houses inherited by people who don’t live in them is good, and earmarking some revenue for wildfires is too, this ballot measure causes more harm than good. Some people might confuse this with Prop 15 because both change property taxes, but they couldn’t be more different, so please let people know: No on Prop 19.`,

Many jails are still in violation of this and operating at over 137% capacity which is cruel to people and a great way to spread COVID-19. In 2014, Prop 47 turned some felonies into misdemeanors (shoplifting, theft up to $950, personal use of most illegal drugs), and people convicted of those crimes were eligible to come out of jail. Two years later, Prop 57 changed the rules around parole, allowing people convicted of nonviolent offenses to be eligible for parole and requiring judges, rather than prosecutors, to decide whether or not to charge juveniles as adults.`,
