            `This is the fight of our lives — led by the person who has been fighting his entire life on behalf of the working class. When other candidates were cozying up to segregationists, Bernie was getting arrested with civil rights leaders. When other candidates voted for war and bloated military budgets, Bernie showed he had the guts to oppose imperialism. While other candidates raise money from Wall Street and fossil fuels and big pharma and the insurance industry, Bernie steers his supporters to picket lines to support workers. While other candidates are fêted by the Democratic establishment and corporate media, Bernie makes enemies of the oligarchy. When other candidates campaign as if this is a personality contest, Bernie says, “Not me, Us.”`,
            `Bernie is not the movement, but he has catalyzed a movement that will win Medicare for All, tuition-free college, a Green New Deal, expanded equality and the protection of reproductive rights. This movement will dismantle mass incarceration, endless wars, wall street omnipotence and anti-worker trade deals. This movement is the strongest coalition to take on the systemic issues of our time. Bernie Sander’s base is the most multi-racial, gender and sexual identity diverse, and, crucially, the most working-class. And only the working class can build the future we deserve.`,

              mainstay Herb Wesson, who just termed out of his reign as
              president of LA City Council in District 10, decided to swap
              seats. Healthy democracy, right?
            </>,
            `Wesson’s failures as city council president are expansive. As Council President, he orchestrated the past term in which Los Angeles faced skyrocketing rents and homelessness and responded almost exclusively with criminalization and neglect. Over 99% of city council votes have been unanimous, and the few times the city council walked back its own inhumane criminalization, such as when it finally voted down the city’s criminalization ordinance of sidewalk sleeping, the result was orchestrated by a revolt of the council’s “progressive” wing (Mike Bonin and Marqueece Harris-Dawson) against Wesson’s rule, in responsive to massive grassroots pressure. He’s also been named (though not indicted) as a person of interest in an FBI investigation into bribery and corruption, centered on Jose Huizar and hotel developments in Downtown Los Angeles. Still, he’s heading into this race as a massive favorite, with well over a million dollars raised and endorsements from the County Democratic Party, most local unions, and an army of establishment city politicians.`,
            `But there’s a hitch. Wesson is facing two other candidates with support from the party establishment. Former City Councilwoman Jan Perry has long been a political opponent of Herb Wesson, with numerous political clashes during their shared time on the city council culminating in Wesson overseeing a redistricting of City Council districts explicitly to break up Perry’s base. Jan Perry has raised over $700,000 for this race, and is endorsed by an array of establishment politicians, albeit a much smaller array. While Jan Perry is probably more progressive than Wesson, it’s not by much. Her most recent position was in Mayor Eric Garcetti’s pro-business “Economic and Workforce Development Department”.`,

              politicians in California. She has raised about $900,000 for this

Janice put in good work on housing issues, got Measure H on the ballot, and subsequently used that money towards shower programs and urgent care beds in San Pedro. She also pushed a rent stabilization ordinance in unincorporated LA County that caps rent increases at 3% and requires just cause for eviction. Contradicting these efforts is her vote to support efforts in overturning Martin v. Boise. Worse still, Hahn supported the appointment of Nicole Tinkham as Interim Public Defender in 2018. Tinkham had no criminal law experience, is a big proponent of law enforcement, and provided civil defense to Sheriff’s Deputy Scott Sorrow after he shot 15-year-old William Fetters in the back while he was biking with his friends.`,

She is more emphatic about decreasing the filing of charges, increasing pre-trial diversions, and creating systems of accountability for the DA’s office. She speaks openly about the long-standing conflict of interest between prosecutors and law enforcement. She advocates for decriminalizing sex work and homelessness, and abandoning gang enhancements. As abolitionist organizations, we typically avoid making recommendations in DA races, but the harm reduction inherent in having non-cop as DA is too significant to ignore. We recommend Rossi.`,

As an active member of the Pasadena Tenants Union, a strong supporter of Bernie Sanders, and former director of PATH (People Assisting the Homeless). He’s likely a long-shot candidate.`,

            `Proposition 13 would authorize $15 billion in bonds for school and college facilities in California, including $9 billion for preschool and K-12 schools, $4 billion for universities, and $2 billion for community colleges. Bond measures are one of the quickest methods of rapidly acquiring financing, but also one of the most frustrating. This matters more than ever for Prop 13, which is the largest school construction bond in state history. The immense amount of support for the bill and the virtual nonexistence of an opposition to it make it hard to argue with. The bill’s focus on matters of safety and not on dubious plans of modernization also make it attractive. The added detail that subsequent construction projects will prioritize union labor makes this YES endorsement a confident one.`,
